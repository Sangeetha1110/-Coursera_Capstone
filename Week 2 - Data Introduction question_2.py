# # Data Preparation:

# The target variable we will be considering for the analysis will be - 'SEVERITYCODE' as it used to depict the severity of the accident. The same is denoted as 0 or 1 within the dataset; where
# 
# "0" denotes Property damage
# "1" denotes Severe Injury

# # Attributes :

# We analyzed that the attributes used to describe the severity of an accident are:
# 
# "WEATHER"
# "ROADCOND"
# "ADDRTYPE"
# "COLLISIONTYPE"
# "LIGHTCOND"

# # Data Cleaning

# The data needs to be cleanned as it is not fit for analysis. There are unncessary columns and also the datatypes needs changing.
